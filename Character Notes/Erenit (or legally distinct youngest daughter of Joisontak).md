Born: Spring AM2

hair a few shades darker than ferdinand, red eyes, massive clawmark scars over the right eye - they were obviously treated, but still look kinda horrifying. The eye is white, having been severely damaged. The area around the eye is still redenned

Blue Priest apprentice after her noble baptism

Was earmarked for a political marriage into an archnoble Leisegang house

Very bored with the primarily bridal education, started sneaking out before her baptism
On her last excursion she ran into a feybeast and barely escaped with her life
The incident left it's scars - less trauma and more the physical scar and her family relationship

Was sent to the temple by her family, with the option to recall her if needed, since the match was cancelled at 7 years old - so Spring AM9

Wanted to be a knight

practically keeps to herself, only comes out of her rooms if she absolutely has to

In the past weave RM never met her, she was purged after Charlottes attack

RM prevents that from happening this time

Rozemyne basically saves her (not just from the attack she didn't know would happen) and gives her a way back into nobility, to get into the RA
Especially since she is one of the few people not judging her for her appearance

Becomes a Guard Knight of Rozemyne, on her insistence

Not head knight but earmarked as her personal bodyguard

Fiercely loyal and protective
