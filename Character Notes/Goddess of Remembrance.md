Former Geduldh Subordinate
One of those goddesses whose importance was kinda lost to time
Used to play a big part in funeral rites and remembering the dead
kinda like Jugereise for leaving home, but this is for leaving life
Entrinduge, Wiegenmilch, Jugereise and her are part of a little group often invoked together - it's kinda like the Seasons but the milestones instead
Divine Instrument - casket? vase?
