Starbinding on Graduation
Though the marriage is not consummated - Dusty can't sense her, thinks she is too sick probably
Basically as soon as her Medal is moved she gets the Grutrissheit tool
She hands it to dusty
the spring after her graduation he is crowned Zent, Adolphine as First Queen
Those two have a decent relationship - but can't meet often

Both are horrendously busy, Rozemyne basically runs the sovereignty alone
Harvest & Taxes for the abandoned duchies
(Sovereignty Duchy) Foundation Supply Duty
She fills a lot of extra chalices - she has no clue where they are from
Over 2-3 years she breaks down completely

Notably, the Grutrissheit Tool only has magical circles
Dusty has no fucking clue thats not the country foundation
Hence, it's never getting filled. The country subsists on Rozemynes Mana via chalices
