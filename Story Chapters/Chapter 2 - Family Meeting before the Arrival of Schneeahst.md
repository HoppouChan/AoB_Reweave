Of course, Rozemyne was an extremely well-behaved girl. Especially now that she actually knew what was normal, and what was just rude. Really, what was she thinking? Of course she would get scolded for using the blanket to gain height. She herself had noticed how dirty everything was. So perhaps her being left with Gerda was just desserts for that. Though she did not think her parents were particularly concerned. Unlike her.

  

Either way, this earnt her a trip to the gate in the morning together with her father, who seemed to be in a sour mood. Still? Or again? Hard to say without more information for her. She leaned forward, resting her upper body on his head. She let her eyes wander a bit while thinking what could have caused that mood. It took a bit, but Anhaltung blessed her before they even made it to the gate despite Gunther's long legs making the trip inherently faster. 

  

"Father? Please do not go too hard on Otto. He will not steal me away either way~"

  

He took a bit to think about that, then nodded slowly. "But if he does anything—"

  

"If Mr. Otto does something I do not want, which I severely doubt will happen, I will inform you as sw— …immediately." 

  

That seemed to abate his anger for a bit. She could certainly feel him relaxing under her. She stroked lightly over his head, and settled down again, walking to the gate mostly in silence.

  

After some more warnings to behave, and what to watch out for, she was deposited at the gatehouse and went inside, immediately heading to the open fire to warm herself up again. 

  

"Good Morning, Mr. Otto." 

  

He seemed a bit surprised at her actually being there, but returned the greeting shortly afterwards. "Good Morning, Myne. I didn’t expect Gunther to actually bring you, and so soon as well…" 

  

Rozemyne made a show of smiling—a broader smile than the unreadable one she wore as a default—and looked off to one side. "That…may be because of me. I asked if I could accompany Ffather to the gate, rather than staying with a babysitter in the neighbourhood. That experience… is just not something I want to repeat." 

  

That seemed to satisfy his curiosity for now. The surprised look disappeared rather quickly, and he took out the stone slate as promised. Honestly, she could think of things she would rather do than go over yet another budget. But she needed to 'learn' how to write again, and this was her best option to do so. Along with being an inroad to her merchant contacts. 

  

He quickly scribbled down her name, and handed the slate to her. "Here, this is your name." He pointed at the writing on the board. "Try to write it until you can manage the letters, then I’ll give you some new words to practice." He moved his finger to the first letter, and sounded them out slowly: "M - A - I - N."

  

Rozemyne nodded and grabbed the chalk pencil in her left hand. As clumsily as if she were writing for the first time—to be fair, that was the case. This body was right handed after all. 

  

She looked up to Otto, lifting her hand a bit. "Like this?"

  

He turned his head to the side slightly. If Rozemyne had to guess, he did not get left-handed people to teach all that often. Of course, she was no exception. She just had way too much practice in writing with her right hand. "Hm… not quite. If you hold it like that, the chalk is gonna skip over the board. Here, let me show you."

  

He reached out to her, and she let her hand get posed like he wanted her to. She ended up with a slightly different grip than what she was used to with her right hand… probably. It had been long since she used chalk. After he was happy with her, she focussed back on her slate and began practicing letters in earnest.

  
  

Using the form of her written letters as a baseline, she still knocked out a good chunk of the alphabet in one day. Made easier by already knowing everything, of course, but writing pretty was more a matter of practice anyways. She helped Otto out by double checking some of the math. In the end, a fairly productive day. Even if she did not have her offer to be an assistant yet. But he seemed rather close to asking. Probably next time.

  

When Gunther ultimately came back from his shift, she happily packed her stuff, said farewells to Otto and walked over to get picked up. Seemingly he could keep his jealousy in check now, since Otto received only a minor glare, not a death stare like last time.

  

The walk home was quiet. Neither of them really knew what to talk about. Which gave Rozemyne a weird feeling in her stomach. A lot of unease, primarily. In the end, she settled once again for cuddling up against his head.

  

She would like to think that her family would still accept her. They had the first time she woke up in Yurgenschmidt. But her mannerisms and whole being were… not quite as foreign at that point. It would be funny if it was not so sad, but the behaviour expected of nobility turned out to be a lot more foreign than her mannerisms from a literal different universe. So, she not only had no choice but to enter the nobility again if she wanted to survive, she also just did not fit in with her family anymore. And that was what really threw her heart into turmoil. 

  

So, as they were rounding one of the last corners before getting to their apartment, she chose to speak up. After all, she could not keep running away from the topic. 

  

She theatrically cleared her throat to indicate she wanted to speak up. "…Father? I imagine you all have a lot of questions for me. Could we have a discussion regarding that today?" 

  

It was certainly better than being accosted by the discussion unexpectedly. Of course she got the reply she was looking for.

  
  

So, she brewed some cheap tea once they were back at their apartment. Gunther and Tuuli were both here, but Rozemyne still wanted to wait for Effa. As far as she knew, she would be coming soon anyways. In the meantime, a tense silence filled the room. Of course, it was never fully silent. She could hear the neighbours on the floor above and below. Gunther was whittling down some wood, more to calm his nerves than to be productive. Tuuli had picked up on the mood and tried to sew some rags together to be used next year. The hearth was crackling, and there was the slight whistling of cooking water. But, most impactfully, none of them talked. Considering she could not exactly talk about Rinsham, sweets and other trends to lighten the mood, like she would usually attempt to, she also wisely shunned Grammatur for the moment.

  

Her heartbeat quickened together with the newly arriving footsteps, and a wave of unease washed over her. Of course, she did not let any of that show on her face. Gretia and Lieseleta could have noticed, but they were just about the only ones. Her favourite exclusives obviously held no chance in that regard. Especially not at this point in time.

  

The door opened, and Effa strode in, her seemingly good mood vanishing in an instant as soon as it hit the atmosphere in the tiny common room. Of course she would notice. It would be hard not to. Rozemyne gave her a slight social smile, before pouring the tea in some wooden cups and serving one to each person present, then sitting down herself. Next to Tuuli, across from her parents. The unease inside her was getting worse, now starting to affect her mana. So she used the opportunity to compress all of it down, as far as possible without collapsing on the spot, and took a sip from her cup to hide her mouth.

  

"So… Myne. You said you wanted to talk." Gunther was the first one to break the silence. 

  

Rozemyne nodded slightly. "I suppose… Verbergen’s Shroud is stretched so thin as to be transparent." She noted the confused expressions around her, made a show of wincing slightly, and corrected herself. "It is not like I am particularly good at hiding it."

  

That got nods all around. Luckily, there was no overt hostility here. Her wounded heart would probably be unable to take that, but the trepidation was unavoidable. 

  

"So… as you have doubtlessly noted, I am not exactly the Myne from two weeks ago."

  

She could hear Tuuli tear up beside her, but her gaze was focused on Gunther. He oozed barely contained fury. If he had mana, she would have no doubt him and Bonifatius were related. "What happened to my daughter then?"

  

Rozemyne had to pick her words carefully here. For all her mana, a confrontation with Gunther would end with a quick trip up a certain staircase. The only reason she was not sent off already was the body she currently inhabited. Probably. 

  

"She… it is difficult to explain. Outlandish even. I <i>am</i> her. A different version, doubtlessly. But still her."

  

That seemed to calm him down somewhat. He was still skeptical, but her body stopped screaming at her that she was in danger. She let her gaze wander a bit. Effa was listening intently, Tuuli was just looking confused. The poor dear. But, she probably should just come out and explain things. It would make things easier for her… even if it would also be somewhat dangerous, and difficult to believe.

  

"To elaborate a bit: it is not my first time being here. Not in the apartment, but at this stitch in Ventuchte’s tapestry. I have lived this life before—waking up from the fever, making rinsham, going to the gate and meeting Otto. And, of course, significantly further, hence…" She made a wide, very unnoble gesture at her whole body. "…This. I have not just memories, but my entire personality from this past life. So that is what happened to your daughter. She grew up in a different [timeline], presumably died, and came back to her five-year-old body.”

  

That was… probably a lot to digest. She looked up from her teacup. Her parents were more contemplative than shocked however. Tuuli looked like she was racking her brain around the concept, which she noticed. 

  

So, Rozemyne took out her newest possession and biggest achievement so far—the stone slate. She marked a point on the left edge. "This is Mynes' birth. The line represents the spinning of Dregarnuhr—the passage of time." These euphemisms had to be obnoxious for her family… but it was also what she was used to. So, the use was unavoidable.

  

She drew a straight line across the slate, then marked two points—one near the start, and one at the end. "This point on the left is today. The point on the right is a week and a half ago for me and about 12 years in the future for you. It is the last moment before I died… probably." She shrugged her shoulders at the shocked expressions. That had to be hard to digest, but… "I’m not certain myself, but I struggle to think of a different possibility."

  

Rozemyne made an arc from the right marking to the left, complete with a directional arrow, then split a second line off from the marking representing today for the new, altered timeline. "So, I do not know much about the exact mechanics… but that is why there was such a stark change."

  

Effa then finally spoke up for the first time. Tuuli wanted to say something to, but let her mother speak first, and settled for a hug with Rozemyne. That… filled her with warmth. It had been so long since she last got to enjoy that feeling. "I have always known that you were loved by the gods… the dreams are enough testament to that. But that does not explain the behaviour… and how you managed to survive that long."

  

Now it was Rozemynes turn to stare like an idiot. Dreams? She never heard of those! "What kind of dreams, mother?" She got a sad smile in return, before Effa quickly explained that part.

  

"Whenever your fevers were especially bad, you dreamt of a world. With metal birds, buildings of glass, where you could walk and run to your hearts content. We assumed that was the world of the Gods."

  

Rozemyne was positively floored. Of course, they lacked context for what they had heard from Myne. But she had that context. She knew those dreams were of her, Urano’s, life in Japan. 

  

She quickly amended her little sketch, with a new incoming arrow. "That… well… to be exact, <i>I</i> am more or less a combination of three different people." She stressed the "I" in that sentence, then tapped on the board, at the beginning of her timeline. "Myne, your daughter." Then, she indicated the newly drawn arrow, arriving from the outside. "Urano Motosu, a young woman who died in a different world—the world Myne saw in her dreams. The first time I came here, these two merged about a week ago when I first woke up from my fever." Now she tapped on the middle of the original timeline. "And finally, Lady Rozemyne Tochter Linkberg Adotie Ehrenfest Aehrtin Zent Sigiswald. The woman who Myne would become, for a variety of reasons. And that is who I consider myself to be."

  

She probably overwhelmed them with the name. Or even the context. The fact that this was a noble name was immediately apparent to everyone, due to the sheer length it possessed and the additional names. 

  

She nodded slightly. "So, in terms of behaviour, I went from being the third Wife of the ruler of the country…" Gunther bristled at the mention of her rank—and honestly, she couldn’t blame him. She would do the same. "…Back to a poor Commoner in the Lower City of Ehrenfest. Please do forgive me, the change is a trial by Glücklitat."

  

Effa and Tuuli had grabbed their own tea while she was talking, and somehow avoided spitting it out when she dropped multiple bombs of that magnitude in short succession. Her own cup was empty at this point.

  

Effa looked at her again, with significantly softer eyes than before. "And… how did Lady Rozemyne come to be? After all, the nobility—"

  

She didn’t mean to cut her off, but she did it anyways. And once that was done, she might as well continue speaking. "So, first, about my illness. It is generally known as The Devouring." Tuuli blanched a little at that name. It was ominous after all. "It refers to a condition in commoners, where they are born with mana. Which is the distinguishing factor that makes nobles noble — more so than any wealth. Due to the sheer amount of mana Myne possessed, it was unavoidable for her to enter noble society in one way or the other. She would have not lived to her baptism otherwise, as too much mana is lethal." That earned her another hug. While she continued talking. Really, she felt terrible regarding Tuuli , so she awkwardly put an arm around her shoulders.

  

She continued, "Instead of becoming a mistress or a slave to a noble, she was adopted as a full-fledged member of the nobility. In terms of public perception, that adoption did not actually happen, and she had always been a noble. Thus, Jugereise danced between us as well. I was not allowed to call you my family past that point." She let out a long sigh, closed her eyes and took another sip of tea. That still weighed on her heart.

  

Gunther, of course, immediately protested, and Tuuli joined him. "Still, you, or Myne, are my sister! I wouldn’t just let you go like that!" He echoed much the same sentiment, but Rozemyne just shook her head softly.

  

"I am afraid this part is not negotiable. And I will do it again." She silenced any potential further protests by immediately continuing. "In my first life, I was prepared to die here, with you, rather than living as a noble slave. Now that I know a brighter path is possible, I will tread it again and protect anyone I care about from harm. That includes you, which is why the severing of ties will be necessary." Honestly, she was not even sure if she should keep the contact they had in the last weave. In the end, she just brought her family unnecessary hardship. Then again, she could probably lift them up inside of Ehrenfest. That had worked fine after all.

  

She lowered her head and made a point of avoiding eye contact in favour of staring at her cup. "I have met a lot of people beyond my immediate circle who are important to me. I want them to live good lives. That is simply not possible by staying out of noble matters, even if I find a way to survive." Of course, she could not save everyone. Her realization regarding Heidemarie made that clear in the worst way possible. But she had to. She had failed so many people already…

  

Effa sighed, but nodded, taking the lead for the rest of the family. It was clear they would not be able to change her mind. And talking to a noble was terrifying either way, even if they were in the body of her little daughter. Myne looked around, as if inviting them to ask further questions. 

  

So of course, she took the opportunity. "If I can still call you daughter…" She received an immediate nod and a significantly warmer smile than usual for that. That brought her to smile too. "I assume you have a plan for how to manage that? I don’t think entering the nobility will be easy."

  

"Of course not. There would be stories about it otherwise. But I do have a plan, and I have started to follow it~" Rozemyne allowed herself to show her merchant grin. "First step is making contact with Mr. Otto." She tapped her slate to show she had already accomplished that much. "And get him to introduce Lutz and myself to his brother-in-law. That will end up giving me the negotiating power to join the temple as a blue-robed shrine maiden. From there, I will have a significantly better chance to join the nobility—after all, blue robes are still noble-born. There is precedent for adoption into noble houses." Of course, most of the info was to prevent the inevitable outrage at the temple.

  

She hugged Tuuli again, who was muttering about her always being her sister. It was endearing, really. So she squeezed her back a bit. 

  

Rozemyne sighed slightly. "I will be busy this winter. And to accomplish my goals, I will need your support. Could you do that for me?"

  

Luckily, she was met only with smiles and determination. How lucky she was to have been born here. There were enough horror scenarios that could have happened. But never with these people. Never.

  
  
  
  
  

Rozemyne knew winter was coming soon and did her best to help out with the preparations. She skipped pig day to spend more time with Otto, after explaining the circumstances to her parents. They were not that keen on the idea, but allowed her eventually. Being a noble surely had its benefits. Of course, she helped with the rest of the winter preparations, including salting out candles and breaking the hinge of the window shutter, again. But the most important part was her getting contracted as Otto's assistant again, this time in return for pencils and some spare cloth and string courtesy of his wife. Of course, it was nothing grand. But it allowed Rozemyne to tackle her former worst enemy: needlework.

  

The blizzards started soon after, shutting the family inside their apartment. Not that Myne could leave, even without that. She still was too weak to even make it down and up the stairs without getting out of breath. So, she fell into a rhythm. Gunther was on the same shift as Otto twice a week, which was when she was carried to the gate as well. She spent the time doing budgets and "learning to write". Slowly but surely, she could feel that all-important introduction creeping closer. On her days off, provided she did not get sick, she helped Tuuli with the baskets, spent her own time with sewing or embroidery, and tried to get in shape as much as her frail body allowed her to. But, in between that, she spent a lot of time in bed. Fevers were considerably rarer than her first time around—compressing mana helped out a lot—but she had to force herself to get up relatively often. Sometimes, she just lost the battle against her inner demons.

  

Thus, Dregarnuhr continued spinning, and time passed, until finally the storms broke after the Lord of Winter was slain. Tuuli had woken up early, noticed the calm weather outside, and got everyone else up to prepare for Parue day. Rozemyne forced herself up too. She had never seen a Parue in her past life, but the description she did hear left only one real possibility—Parue was very obviously a Feytree. Probably a high quality ingredient too. She would have to get at least some. So, she petitioned her parents. "Mother, Father, I would like to go with you. I cannot climb the trees, obviously, but I suspect that I will be able to help you despite that."

  

They had already found out that at this point, it was a better idea to just listen to Myne. But, there still was some lingering hesitancy for their daughter. While her mind might be as old as them, her body was still incredibly frail. But, in the end, they were convinced. So the whole family of four suited up and made their way out of the city.
