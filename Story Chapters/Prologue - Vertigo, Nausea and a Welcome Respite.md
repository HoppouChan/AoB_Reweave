Exhaustion permeated every facet of Rozemyne’s body. She was not new to feeling like the dirt under one's boots. After all, ever since she came into this world, she regularly had to stay in bed for extended periods of time. That had gotten better for a while—now she was at the start again however. Arguably even worse, given that this exhaustion was not purely physical. She was just <i>done</i>. Her body wanted to rest, her mind wanted to rest—ideally by reading an actual book—and her mana wanted to rest. The final in particular was an entirely new, yet by now depressingly familiar feeling.

  

She had just received a direct order to evacuate. Why? That was of course something no one deigned her to inform with. It certainly seemed to be important, judging by the tone of the aide's voice. Apparently not important enough for Sigiswald to inform her personally though. Well, even if, she severely doubted he even remembered Rozemyne existed. He needed his entourage to remember she even lived here after all.

  

But she did not really want to. Logically, she knew. Whatever whipped up the staff into such a frenzy, it was dire circumstances. Direct harm to her well-being. But… she just wanted to <i>rest</i>. Nobody would care if that got her killed anyways. Why survive if her struggles would just continue? At least she would get to sleep for longer than two bells for a change if she did not.

  

While she sat dazed on the edge of her bed, someone was talking to her rapidly. Maybe about exactly that if she had to guess. The woman seemed frantic. Probably frustrated with the lack of response. But why bother? A glimpse at the cloak told her this was one of "her" retainers from Gilessenmeyer. 

  

She continued to ignore the incessant prattling. But she probably should start doing something. After all, there were still people she had to protect. If nothing else, her Namesworn trusted her with their life. She could not just give up without disappointing them. Too bad this was a job she could not just quit. Someone really should get round to introducing labour rights as a concept in this world.

  

Dazed, with painfully slow movements, she grabbed a feystone from her night desk. Some magic tools were always kept close at hand. Ordonnanz being among them for obvious reasons. She needed a way to contact her retainers in an emergency. This qualified. Presumably. She still had not processed whatever the woman in front of her was saying, and she did not plan to. 

  

Rozemyne manifested her Schtappe, tapped the small feystone in her hand, and spoke into it with a weak voice. "Lieseleta. Prepare my riding clothes. Meet me at the teleporter into the Sovereignty as soon as possible. We are evacuating." 

  

Her trusted attendant, one of the few she had, would be able to inform the rest. Her Ehrenfest retainers would be leaving. She stopped caring about the rest. 

  

With effort, she managed to stand up from the edge of her bed without immediately collapsing back down. That was some progress at least. She blinked a few times to clear her eyesight. Clothes were actually prepared for her. But if she had to get out, she did not want to spend the time getting dressed anyways. What for? It’s not like she had any dignity left, and it would not be the first time she went to work in her nightgown. So why bother getting dressed? Ignoring the presumed protests of that woman, she fastened the belt with her magic tools over her nightclothes and just began walking. Slowly. Not as slow as she had been once, but still painfully slowly despite the apparent urgency. Theoretically she would be able to walk faster, but that would require a cooperating body.

  

So in the end, her making her way to the teleporting room took its time. She had to pay attention to not literally get run over in the halls, and her tempo resembled an elder more than the youthful woman she was supposed to be. Judging by the slight wince in her retainers’ faces—the ones who watched, but did not know her well enough to look beyond the make-up—she looked terrible. Completely understandable. That’s why she used it after all.

  

Finally, she reached her destination. To her surprise, fast enough even. The sweet release of death had not caught up with her yet despite the commotion somewhere behind her growing a bit louder, presumably by getting closer. The thought brought her on a tangent again. Would that release even be sweet? She did not know if she had the fortitude to climb a gigantic staircase in her current state, after all. Then again, would that even transfer? She would not have a body that could hurt at that stage anyway.

  

She gave a small nod to the gathered retainers she actually cared about: Ottilie, Lieseleta, Gretia, Philine, Roderick. A rather small group given the total size of her entourage. But her knights were not here, and neither were her two fanatics. Only Matthias stuck directly by her side at the moment. 

  

Rozemyne gestured at the magic circle on the ground. "Go ahead." She could already see the protests forming on the faces of her personnel—they probably wanted her to go first. But she could not do that. Both physically and emotionally.

  

"Once I go through, I will deactivate the circle from the other side to make sure no attackers follow us. So my group is going to be the last," she spoke with as much finality as she could manage to put in her voice. Not much, but enough for the retainers who knew her better than herself to tell that this was non-negotiable. "Inform the rest, then leave. I will follow with Matthias and Laurenz." That still did not seem to be enough of an argument to convince them… so Rozemyne decided to just play it heavy handed. "Queen’s order."

  

A trio of knights went ahead, while her attendants sent out a flurry of Ordonnanz to inform the rest of her retainers and noble personnel. Some visibly refused to fly, she noticed. In rather quick succession, her knights also trickled in. She told the Sovereignty nobles the same thing—if they wanted to get out, they had to go now, before her, and power the circle themselves. She would have offered to do it some years ago… but now she did not have the leeway.

  

The whole affair concluded quite rapidly. In the end, only those two namesworn knights were with her, Leonore, Cornelius and Angelica having left just seconds before, urging her to hurry. The reason for that was not hard to guess—heavy footsteps were rapidly growing closer. She waved the two knights to follow her and stepped on the circle herself. A deep breath to steady herself, before she closed her eyes and concentrated on the relatively meager amount of mana left in her to move it into the circle below her feet.

  

Suddenly, she was overtaken by a strong feeling of vertigo and nausea. '<i>What?</i>' Her tired brain could not make sense of the sensation—that had never happened before, especially not when teleporting.

  
  
  

Before she could make sense of the feeling though, it was gone. Together with the ambient noise and a myriad of other things. She could tell something had changed. Why was she lying down? '<i>Did I faint?</i>' To her, it felt like no time had passed however. Literally none—she could not even remember falling. But she must have.

  

Slowly, Rozemyne took stock of her surroundings, as good as possible. She was hot. Unbearably so. A particularly strong fever, probably her body’s way of going on strike. She was lying down, and could not open her eyelids heavy like lead. Her head itched, as did her back. She did not spend long conscious anyways—most likely she just passed out and was brought to her bed. Whatever issues arose, they could wait until she was awake again. She deserved this. And so, the girl passed out again.

  

When she came to again, not much had changed, barring the feeling of something wet and moderately cold on her forehead. A wet cloth, most likely. This time, her eyelids were slightly lighter than lead, so she could open them with effort. The scene in front of her eyes did not make sense however—a blurry image of almost exclusively brown. Given she was lying on her back, that had to be the ceiling, but how? It had been years since she had seen anything other than a ceiling in one or more divine colours. So unless everyone hid a secret eighth primary god from her, she was in a wooden building. With effort, she raised an arm and rubbed her eyes to remove the dirt and hopefully the blurriness. 

  

The picture that presented itself after that was not much better—a dirty wood ceiling, broken up by some cobwebs. '<i>Where am I?</i>' She tried to turn around to look to her side, but stopped shortly. Her hand… she tried to form a fist, and open it again. The hand in her vision copied the movements. ‘<i>But it’s so tiny! Why does my hand look like a toddler’s?</i>' 

  

Before she could solve this particular mystery however, there was movement somewhere next to her. Footsteps. She tensed up, fully expecting someone to burst into wherever it was she was resting. But she only heard a door creaking, closely followed by a whispered voice. "Myne? Have you woken up?"

  

That voice… that name! She immediately shot up in her bed—an action she immediately regretted, considering the way the world began to spin around her. But there was no way she would mistake that for anything in the world. Her Mom! Effa! She did not care if that was a vivid hallucination born from fatigue, the afterlife, or anything else. One look at that concerned, slightly dirty face was enough. She immediately began to bawl like a little kid.
