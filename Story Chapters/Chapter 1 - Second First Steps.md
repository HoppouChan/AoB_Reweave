Rozemyne would imagine she could be forgiven for her little outburst upon seeing her mother again. Of course, she knew that was not proper behaviour. This was not a hidden room, after all, even if she instinctively felt more comfortable than at any point in the past few years. But there did not seem to be anyone around to judge her for it anyways. Still, she let herself get shushed and calmed down quickly. Inadvertently hurting her mother would be terrible!

  

She was provided a fresh cup of cold water, before being left alone again. On her request. She did not plan on actually sleeping again, but she needed space to gather her thoughts. First things first—she was unbearably hot. An almost nostalgic feeling really, given that she had not come anywhere close to mana overload after moving to the Sovereignty. 

  

So she got to work removing that immediate issue–boiling her mana down like soup, folding it down like cloth, compressing the cloth, then putting it in her trusty box. The effort left her exhausted, but now she had some breathing room. Even more than she expected, to be exact.

  

She settled back down into the straw bed and stared at an indeterminate point on the dirty ceiling. There was a <i>lot</i> of space in her now. It practically felt like her mana was barely compressed beforehand. Obviously, there were her surroundings. She knew that ceiling like the back of her hand, considering how much time she had spent staring up on it. But why was she even here? Why were <i>her parents</i>—presumably, but at least Effa—here? They followed her into the Sovereignty as exclusive personnel, so how come both of them were clearly in Ehrenfest now?

  

The smoking gun ended up being her tiny hands. She had never grown to be a tall woman, even after removing most of the mana that hindered her growth. But even as a fully grown tiny adult, her hands were bigger than those she could lift in front of her face. Other things could be excused—eschewing baths would also lead to an itchy scalp for example, but there was no way she knew of to make the bones in her fingers smaller.

  

Improbable as it sounded, this conclusively meant she was in the past. Or this was a rather vivid hallucination before she finally reached the foot of the Towering Staircase, but that would not really change much either. So going off of the first assumption, she landed sometime before she invented Rinsham… which was basically the first thing she did after waking up in this world. So, she could just assume to be back to square one. The reasons as to why eluded her, but she did not need them anyways. She was just happy to be around her family again.

  

Rozemyne remembered the last time she was rather antsy to get out of bed. It was understandable considering the state the bedroom was in. Really, she should feel the same now, but she just could not be bothered. Winter was coming soon, and there was not all that much she would have to redo before then in order to trace her steps. So, for the first time in a long while, she could just stay laying back in bed and close her eyes, without anyone interrupting her for paperwork or mana.

  
  
  

Two days passed like that until her fever, caused by some nebulous exertion in the past and mana overload, went away. She spent much of that time asleep. Her frail body certainly needed it, and her mind, scarred with a wholly new kind of exhaustion the most grueling university cram session could not compete with, certainly appreciated the rest too. In the time she was awake, between once again cursing the food practices of Yurgenschmidt and basking in the care of her mother, she mulled over her way forward. 

As much as she would like to… just not, noble society was practically unavoidable for her. So, first point of order, she would have to get back in. Probably the biggest issue in front of her. Everything beyond that she was able to scheme around, probably. It had been a while since she had the spare time to do so, but she was confident in her abilities. But first, she had to get into noble society—a practically insurmountable hurdle, since there was not exactly a nice high bishop she could appeal to in order to launder her identity. She could do that herself—pass herself off as Rozemary's daughter by blood. The cover story was believable enough after all, certainly worth considering. But she would need evidence to back that claim lest she draw the ire of Elvira. And that was certainly one scary prospect.

  

The other way she could think of was her plan A from the previous timeline, before she let herself get derailed by the presence of books. Her biggest obstacle in that sense, one High Priest Ferdinand Sohn Ehrenfest, also represented her biggest opportunity. If nothing else, she could count on him to actually negotiate with her for her mana… which was also the only kind of leverage she had. So that was probably the best course of action everything considered. Maybe he would even have retained his memories, like her? She would not bet on that, it was severely improbable after all… but a girl could dream.

  

For either of these to work, Rozemyne would have to get <i>to</i> work however. In order to even get to the temple, she would need connections in the northern part of Ehrenfest city. So she would have to meet Benno. To do that, Otto was just about the only way. Also, she needed to reproduce Rinsham anyways—not even the overwhelming need to just stay in bed could win out against her head itching at this point. So, in the afternoon of day 3 in Ehrenfest, she once again got slowly out of her bed, slipped inside her wooden clogs and walked to the door to softly knock on it. The first time it was an epic struggle for her to open that exact door. This time… it opened by itself, revealing her big sister on the other side. 

  

"G—... Hi, Tuuli. Heil—... I feel a lot better now." Awkwardly, she continued stumbling over her words. 

  

Really, it was understandable. She had spent more than a decade deeply immersed in Noble culture, and she even started to understand what was going on in the last few years. So once again switching to informal commoner language was practically impossible. At least she did not hit Tuuli with the "Greetings" she was instinctively going to start with.

  

Her sister looked at her slightly concerned, probably thanks to the whole tripping over her tongue thing, but nonetheless brushed aside her bangs and laid a flat hand over her forehead. "Mh, yeah, your fever seems to have gone down, Myne. You should probably still stay in bed for a bit though." 

  

Rozemyne nodded in response to that. She did not plan on doing a whole lot today. So that request was fine with her. 

  

"Of course, I was just wondering if we perhaps have anything left over from lunch?" 

  

The same look flitted over her sister's face again. Did she say something weird? In the end though, neither of them chose to comment on it, instead Tuuli placed a bowl of minimally lukewarm soup and hard bread on the table. 

  

Awkwardly, Rozemyne waited for a bit for someone to pull out her chair, before her brain caught up and she realised no one would be doing that for her here. So, finally, she pulled out one of the stools and plopped herself down on it—a task for which she pathetically had to use mana enhancement to not overtax her body. The spoon in her hand also felt weird. Instinctively, she tried to hold it the way she was supposed to. But, of course, that was simply not possible—she could not even thread the grip in between her fingers. They did not open that far! Knowing herself, she probably would not even be able to exert enough force on the grip to lift the spoon from the bowl. So she awkwardly gripped the wooden utensil in her fist, and began to eat the flavourless broth at a slow, measured pace. As if this were a formal lunch invitation, rather than her grabbing something to eat when she had the opportunity.

  

Rozemyne raised her head again after a few spoonfuls to see what Tuuli was doing. Apparently, she had interrupted her by waking up, as she was practicing sewing with her mother’s tools and some old rags. Now, that certainly sparked memories in her… not just of her last time here, but also the embroidery bootcamp she was forced to endure before her move to the Sovereignty. The realization she had not practiced in this body at all, and not for multiple years in general, sent a shiver down her spine. Another thing on her ever growing list of tasks to do. 

  

"Mh, Tuuli? Do you know how late it is? And how long until Mom comes back?" She took another bite, chewed slowly, and swallowed the meat down before adding: "Also, were you in the forest today? I did not really notice anything that happened today…”

  

“It should be close to fourth bell, so I imagine she’ll be home soon, unless something keeps her. But there really shouldn’t be anything that I know of at least.  And yeah, I was. Sorry for leaving you again, but I don’t think you’d be able to keep up." 

  

Even without the sickness that would be the case, but that part was better left unsaid. She knew her sickness caused Myne to throw tantrums rather often, so she’d just avoid provoking one to keep the peace. Though, she seemed to take it well. That just reinforced the fact that something had changed in her.

  

Rozemyne nodded. “Currently I do not think I would even manage the trip to the well. If anything, I just feel bad that someone has to look over me most of the time." 

  

As the only person that did not have to work or was the subject that had to be watched over, that role naturally fell to Tuuli. In return, that also meant she had to bring home more when she went to the forest. The family relied on that after all, which did nothing to make Rozemyne feel less of a burden. She wished she was sent back like a year later, at that point she would at least have things to do already. For now, there was nothing to do for her, other than try to make contact with Otto again. But she had the opportunity to speed things up a bit right now. So of course she took it. 

  

"I imagine you are going to the forest again tomorrow? Could you please try to bring an extra Meryl back for me?"

  

At least that part did not provoke any significant challenges. She was probably pitied, so the Meryl was an easy enough thing to make her feel better. Though no one, other than Rozemyne herself, knew why she would even want one.

  

She was still working on her broth when Effa came back home. She greeted her, got her temperature checked, and got a smile when she headed back to bed after finishing her food. The bed was not nearly as comfortable alone, of course, and she could still hear the other two talking in the kitchen, but she fell asleep again soon enough.

  
  
  

The next day, she woke up early enough to eat breakfast with her whole family before seeing them off. She planned on having the whole day for herself, maybe getting started on cleaning the bedroom. There was not too much plotting to be done yet, she needed <i>industries</i> after all to remember this years in the future. Instead, she was blindsided by repeating one of the darkest facets of her early childhood in Yurgenschmidt—being sent to Gerda to be babysat. Of course, she ended up doing most of the babysitting required, other than cleaning up behind toddlers. Needless to say, any plans she had for the day were completely derailed, until she could throw herself into Tuuli’s arms and get away from that place again. Rozemyne sincerely hoped she would not have to see that "Daycare" from the inside again.

  

In the evening, she squirreled her Meryl away before it could be used for food. She was too tired to make Rinsham on the same day, but she put it on her agenda for tomorrow and preemptively recruited Tuulis help.

  
  
  

The next day ended up significantly better after the daycare mishap, not that that was a big improvement. But she was able to accompany Effa to the market! So she let herself get carried and looked at the crowds they met in the city. Of course, one issue was now on the forefront of her mind, so she spoke up as soon as they got out of the immediate neighbourhood. 

  

"...Mother? Can I accompany Father to the gate in the future instead of going to Gerda? Even if not, I really do not like it there." 

  

She did not catch the changes in Effas facial expression due to her vantage point, so the only thing she could go off of was the response. Which was promising at least.

  

"We can see how that will go, but I don’t think there are many days when we’re all out anyways before Winter. But you have to behave yourself!"

  

Rozemyne nodded fiercely, before also verbally agreeing. 

  

That done, they continued their way through the city. She made sure to share her observations, insofar as they were appropriate for a kid in her situation. She needed plausible deniability for things she should not know after all. She did not know if she did a good job however.

But on the whole, she marked this outing down as a success. This time, she did not pass out when seeing the butchered animals. She did not even really show a reaction! Elvira would have been proud… Also, she made sure to ask for her numbers. The only detractor from the experience was that one stand that had a book, the only one she ever found in the lower city. It reminded her of Heidemarie. Was she still alive at this point? She never found out exactly what happened, and when. But if she remembered correctly, her would-be sister-in-law died around this time due to poisoning. She immediately felt the guilt rise up in her. Maybe she should do something to help her? But how? She supposedly did not know how to read or write, let alone have the connections to pass a message along. And if she timed it wrong, it would just make herself look incredibly suspicious. So, regrettably, there was nothing she could do in this instance. Another cut thread woven into the cloak weighing her down. 

  

Not that she let any of that show. She was sort of glad to be back in their apartment. The smell was better, too. While Effa was putting away the things they bought, Rozemyne brought her Meryl from the day before out too, as well as asked for the juicing supplies. Of course, the weights were beyond her. But the hammer was doable, from experience. She made sure to separate enough oil for her plans into a separate bowl, and got her family to let her "play" with the relatively small amount of oil left. Of course, she knew exactly what she was doing. Some herbs, salt and hot water later, she once again had a non-itchy scalp and the gratitude of her family. It certainly was an overdue development from her perspective. Still, she smiled at the sincere congratulations and let herself be praised for it.

  
  
  

With this first point of order done, there were two other things she wanted to get done before the winter hit Ehrenfest. Both in her own self interest of course. She wanted to make contact with Otto and get her home in a presentable state. So she spent the rest of the day doing the latter, also enlisting Gunther to help her in a variety of ways. Making a hairstick so her hair stopped falling in her face, cleaning cobwebs, helping her sweep and so on. 

In the end, she did not get to the gate any faster than her first time around, but at least it was time well spent making herself feel less dirty. Though she missed her hot baths.

  

The situation leading up to her first meeting with Otto ended up being exactly the same as her last time. She distinctly remembers there being a whole ordeal of her being too weak to get to the gate, but having to go anyway since Tuuli could not leave her alone. That was how she met Lutz after all! The thought even made her sniffle a bit, though she kept her tears in check. Thinking forward a bit, she suggested Tuuli bring her basket. After all, she would probably be exhausted once they got to the gate, even if she was a bit healthier and despite being carried. She relayed this as well, and her sister agreed. So she would go foraging, and Myne would simply wait for her dad to be done at work. 

  

The walk was rather uneventful, she mostly listened in on Tuuli’s conversation. She tried talking to Lutz a bit, with a middling success. Sadly, she was not Ferdinand, and thus could not remember everything she had said on that walk. 

  

The rest ended up as planned though. They delivered Gunther’s lunch, she waved the kids goodbye, and got to wait in one of the waiting rooms while the soldiers handled a noble requesting entry into the city, specifically Giebe Reunwalt. It struck her as a bit odd that someone of such high status would enter through the southern gate. But there was probably some business afoot he would not want to get out. Or he could have visited Leisegang beforehand. Rozemyne figuratively put a pin on that thought. Hopefully she would still remember when she got the resources to write things down.

  

But writing things down was a good segue anyways. After bartering with Gunther for a bit, she could stay at the gate until his shift ended so he could carry her back. And because he had the coziest spot, Otto got stuck with babysitting duty for her. Which just played right into her hands. She made sure to look interested in what he was doing, while thoroughly looking over the ledger he was working on. Of course, without other ledgers to compare it to she could not do too much anyways. But one thing she was able to do was how she got the place as Otto's assistant the first time around. 

  

"You made a mistake there. 116 plus 174 is 290, not 280." She pointed at the line where she spotted the error too. 

  

Otto finished the line he was currently working on, looked at the place she indicated, used his calculator and then nodded, before correcting the minor mistake. "I thought you couldn’t read?" He sounded a bit suspicious, but not overly accusatory. 

  

Lucky for her, the last thing she needed was to get on Otto's bad side.

  

So she shook her head slightly. "I can not, but I have learnt numbers. So I can read those at least." 

  

He appeared thoughtful for a bit, before offering her his old stone slate once again. An offer she gladly accepted of course. She could tell he wanted to ask more, but held back. Rozemyne could imagine what was on his mind—paperwork season was soon to come after all. This was really just minor stuff compared to the winter.

  

Of course, that meant she was in a good mood again when Gunther came to pick her up. Which made him somewhat less happy for some reason. But she did not pay too much attention to that. For now, she looked forward to getting home again, and then to getting her stone slate soon~
